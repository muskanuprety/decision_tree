The python file decision.py is used to implement a decision tree for a binary classification problem. To run the program, give
the following command in your terminal:

python3 decision.py (filename)

(filename) is a tab delimited file in a table format which the program will read and implement the classifying algorithm.

Some expample files are also provided for reference and to test out the algorithm.

The program's output is a vertical printout of the tree structure along with its train set and test set accuracy.
